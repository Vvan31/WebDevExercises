            <h2>What are the 5 love languages?</h2>
            <p>
                We all give and receive love in 5 different ways: 
                Words of affirmation, Acts of service, Receiving gifts, 
                Quality time, and Physical touch. These are called ‘love 
                languages’ - a concept created by Dr. Gary Chapman through 
                his long-time work as a marriage counsellor.
            </p>
            <p>Different people with different personalities give and 
                receive love in different ways. By learning to recognize 
                these preferences in yourself and in your loved ones, you 
                can learn to identify the root of your conflicts, connect 
                more profoundly, and truly begin to grow closer.

                <h2>1. Words of affirmation</h2>

                <div class="overlay">
                    <p class="text">When words of affirmation is your love language, words 
                        build you up. You thrive on spoken affection, praise, 
                        encouragement, and compliments. Harsh words and criticism 
                        can bother you for a long time.</p>

            <div class="wraper">
                <h2>2. Acts of Service</h2>
                <img src="img/acts-of-service.png" class="image">
                <div class="overlay">
                    <p class="text">Anything that your partner does willingly to ease your 
                        workload is a sign of love to you. You feel cared for 
                        when your partner vacuums before you get to it or makes 
                        you breakfast as a surprise. On the other hand, broken 
                        promises or laziness can make you feel unimportant.  </p>

                <h2>3. Receiving gifts</h2>
                <img src="img/romantic.png" class="image">
                <div class="overlay">
                    <p class="text">When you speak this love language, a thoughtful gift 
                        shows to you that you are special. In contrast, generic 
                        gifts and forgotten special events have the opposite 
                        effect. This love language isn’t necessarily materialistic 
                        – it could be as simple as receiving your favourite snack 
                        after a bad day.</p>

                <h2>4. Quality time</h2>
                <img src="img/guys-videogames.png" class="image">
                <div class="overlay">
                    <p class="text">To you, nothing says you’re loved like undivided attention. 
                        When your partner is truly present (and not looking at their 
                        phone), it makes you feel important.  Failure to actively 
                        listen or long periods without one-on-one time can make you 
                        feel unloved.</p>

                <h2>5. Physical touch</h2>

                <div class="overlay">
                    <p class="text">Holding hands, kisses, hugs, and other touches are your preferred 
                        way to show and receive love. Appropriate touches convey warmth 
                        and safety, while physical neglect can drive a wedge between you 
                        and your partner.</p>
